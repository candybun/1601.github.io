    <h2>Ethical issues relating to Mobile Payment, personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

    <p>
        <em>
            As a new type of payment method, mobile payment has developed rapidly all over the world. For consumers, it is convenient and fast, and for merchants, the calculation is convenient and the cost is low. 
            In Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, and China, it has become the largest transaction method. 
            It seems that except for some dispensable risks, mobile payment seems to be a perfect transaction method. 
            After all, it works so well in Japan, South Korea, China, and other countries. 
            Is this really the case? Of course not, I can use my Personal experience to tell some of the problems under the surface of the mobile payment boom.<br /> <br />
            When I returned to China in 2019, it was the first time I returned to my home country after 5 years. 
            When I was still in New Zealand, I heard from my friends how widespread the development of mobile payment is in China. 
            But when I really walked on the street, I realized that mobile payment is so popular in China. 
            Every store has a QR codesign. The waiter in the restaurant uses the QR code to collect tips,
            and there is a QR code on the bus. Even the temples have begun to use QR codes to receive incense money, and people¡¯s transfer payments are all QR codes. 
            I was shopping in the street for a day, all the young people used to scan codes, and only a few old people used cash..<br /><br />
            I think the problem with Ethical issues relating to mobile payment is that it has a threshold for use. 
            For young people with fast learning ability, this is not difficult, it is very convenient and fast, but for elderly people who don¡¯t even know how to use smartphones, by the end of 2019, the number of elderly people aged 60 and over in China reached 254 million, accounting for a proportion of the total population. 18.1%, can you make these elderly people adapt to mobile payment and use QR codes to receive and pay on their mobile phones every day? There is also a large group of people with disabilities, such as blind and deaf-mute people. It is not easy for them to integrate into the lives of ordinary people. Braille is used on CHY banknotes, and the banknotes vary in size. Blind people mainly rely on touch to distinguish the differences. 
            Face value banknotes, in this almost cashless society, should blind people touch the QR code on the phone screen? This is impossible. I feel a deep gulf between young people and these old people and the disabled. In this mobile payment carnival, these people are far behind. This is indeed a technological advancement, but I feel that it is a step backward in terms of ethics and morals. This is definitely an important issue that needs to be resolved as soon as possible in mobile payment.<br /><br />
           
            Therefore in my suggestion, I do not recommend the introduction of a large number of QR code mobile payments in New Zealand, because the PayWave technology in New Zealand is very mature. Scanning with a mobile phone seems to be the same as scanning with a bank card. There is no need to take a lot of risks to using mobile payment.
