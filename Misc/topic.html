    <h1>Mobile Payment</h1>


    <h4>What is mobile payment:</h4>
    <p>
        Mobile payment refers to electronic money payment for products or services through portable electronic devices (such as cell phones or smartphones). 
        Instead of using a check, cash or bank card payment, 
        mobile payment effectively unites the Internet, electronic devices, and financial institutions to form a new type of payment system£¨Ghiciuc£¬2014).

    <h4>Why we chose this topic: </h4>
    <p>
        Since metal objects were first used as money in the later part in the eighth century B.C. (Galbraith, 2017), 
        human economics are highly relying on currencies. When time comes into the information era, 
        technology has taken in place of many things to make human life more convenient, and mobile payment is one of them. As one of the newest payment method, 
        mobile payment is predicted to be growing (Statista, 2021). 
        We would like to take a look at this newest payment method, and investigate into the opportunities, risks, and choices of Mobile payment.
