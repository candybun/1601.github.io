    My attitude towards mobile payment is to accept and like this novel payment method because it not only facilitates my daily consumption, but also reduces my dependence on cash.<br /><br />
    In recent years, as a new type of payment method, mobile payment has developed rapidly around the world. Its development prospects are broad, and its development momentum is extremely strong. The market scale is expanding rapidly. Among them, Japan, South Korea, and Kenya are typical representatives of foreign mobile payment development, especially Japan. It has the reputation of "the country of mobile payment".<br /><br />
    For consumers, it is convenient and fast, and for merchants, it is easy to calculate, and the cost is low. This is the characteristic of mobile payment. Consumers can use software (such as GOOGLE PAY, ALIPAY), smart devices (such as smart watches, smart bracelets) to complete the payment process in just a few steps or use a smart phone to touch the POS machine (PAYWAVE), compared to cash or checks greatly reduce the payment steps. Consumers can view their own income and expenditure in real time through the software and can easily count the income and expenditure of their stores for one day, one month, and one year.<br /><br />
    However, mobile payment also has shortcomings that need to be improved. For example: the confidentiality of user information, the security of payment methods, and the weak legal protection of the payment process. This increases the possibility of criminals using mobile payments to commit fraud. For this issue, I have the following suggestions: 1. Relevant organizations and platforms should work together to ensure that personal information is safe during transmission and use. 2. Introduce relevant laws, implement relevant measures, and strengthen market supervision and management. 3. Strengthen personal awareness of prevention and do not trust strangers easily.<br /><br />
    I hope that mobile payment will continue to provide people with convenience and efficiency in the future.
