<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>As someone who is always fascinated to the latest technologies, mobile payment is something that I would hope one days being widely used in the society. There were a few times that I forgot to bring my wallet. A whole day of class without eating can be miserable, that¡¯s when I feel thankful that I could still get food by paying by my phone. Mobile payment is the new payment method that has quite a few advantages like convenience and efficiency, but every coin has its two sides, it also has risks that could possibly cause ethical issues. Firstly, most of the mobile payment devices allow payments without a pin. That means, if someone lost his/her phone, they also have a higher chance of money and information being defrauded. The rapid development of society and technology also is causing difficulties for some people, especially the elders. Many people these days rely on smart phones for work, study, and life, while some finds it hard to cope with. Therefore, a reliable payment security system is necessary. Banks and financing institutes should be more careful and stricter when permitting one¡¯s payment gathering permissions. Bank card and cash payment should not be abandoned while new payment methods being used. Not only people who do not cope well with technology would need the classical methods, it also is a backup option that people can take when technology issues happen causing mobile payment not  able to be processed properly.</em></h4><br>
