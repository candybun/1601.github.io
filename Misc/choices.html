    <h1>Technology Choices<br><br></h1>
    <p>Now that mobile payment is rapidly developing. We also need to pay attention to the choices of mobile payment.<br /></p>


    <h4>Novel payment ways</h4>
    <p>
        When thinking about mobile payment ways used in our daily life, what would you think about?
        Apple pay and Google pay would be the main methods that we could use in physical shops for mobile payments.
        Apple pay and Google pay take two devices, which are a phone that has Apple/Google pay installed in, and a payWave machine.
        It is already convenient that we could get rid of the card holder, and shop with just a phone in the bag, but what can be even better is that if we could even make payments involving one less device.
        Research shows that, the easier to use the user feel the payment method is, the more useful they feel the payment method is (Kim, Mirusmonov & Lee, 2010).
        Fingerprint payment and face payment are under development at the moment, that hopefully one day,
        people could just put their finger on the recognizing device, or in front of a camera, instead of taking their phones out and approach the payWave machine.
        That could so much promote the efficiency of payments, especially for places like grocery stores that always queues.<br />
    </p>

    <h4>Globalization<br></h4>
    <p>
        Thinking deeper into the current mobile payment methods, one problem can be noticed that is,
        whether we are throwing our phone onto a payWave machine, or making an online payment on a mobile device, we very much reply on a credit card!
        Without having a credit card on the first hand, there is no way you could make a mobile payment. Indeed, credit cards are very widely used in most of the modern countries.
        However, there is barely any credit card that is international enough to be used on all shopping websites from all countries.
        That means, the chances of overseas shopping are limited when we do not have a credit card that is approved by a foreign country.
        Mobile payment is still not globalized enough to let us shop all around the world sitting at home.
        Building wide partnerships would result in a competitive advantage for mobile payment (de Luna, Liébana-Cabanillas, Sánchez-Fernández & Muñoz-Leiva, 2019).<br />
    </p>

    <h4>Lower payment costs<br></h4>
    <p>
        Have you ever noticed the little stickers on a payWave machine that says ‘no payWave’ when you are dinning at a small restaurant? 
        The reason for that is the business owners are charged for customers using the payWave machine. The costs are from 0.4% to 2% depending on the bank rates. 
        That may seem small, but when calculating this amount with the profit margin, that becomes something not to be ignored. 
        The business owners try to avoid this cost by not letting the customers use payWave, or some of them decide to charge extra from the customers who wish to use the payWave. 
        This is very much limiting the use of mobile payments in the society, as it is shown that consumer acceptance is very much based on the level of the cost and ease of use (Van der Heijden, 2002). 
        But there is not only just one way to make a payment. As an example, QR codes are widely used in China as a payment method. 
        Instead of having to pay for a payWave machine, a QR code is all it takes to be able to provide mobile payment options to the customers. 
        Even for businesses as small as a food stand are providing QR code payments, as it basically takes nothing than a piece of paper with the QR code printed on top of it. 
        Less payment costs is an actual benefit that allows people to use mobile payments with less concerns.<br />
    </p>

    <h4>Security and Publicity<br></h4>
    <p>
        When something new comes into one’s life, people always have a concern of whether it is safe to use. 
        It is very common and natural. Just think about when Wi-Fi first came into our life, it was once being suspected of having an effect to health for the radiation. 
        The truth is Wi-Fi radiofrequency signals are way not high enough to cause any damage to human bodies (Ministry of Health, 2021). 
        It takes time to build trust. Now back to mobile payment, it is firstly necessary to have the payment system safe enough to stand the test of time, 
        so that people who are willing to try and use mobile payments finds it safe and convenient and stays. 
        Besides, consumer behaviour is another challenge that affects the safe level of mobile payment (Karnouskos, 2004). 
        Consumers need to be reminded what to do to avoid scams and frauds through publicity. Secondly, to let more people know about mobile payment and it is safe, publicity is the key. 
        Out of advertisements, news and websites, word of mouth can also be very helpful. 
        By its convenience and efficiencies, mobile payment can surely bring benefits into the society. 
        Technology changes life, we are optimistic that one day mobile payment becomes the mainstream payment method in our daily life.<br />
