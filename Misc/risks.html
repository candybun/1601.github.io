    <h1>Technology Risks</h1>
   
    <h4>Third-party platform risk</h4>
    <p>
        With the continuous development of third-party mobile payment, people's lifestyles and behavior habits have undergone tremendous changes. The third-party mobile payment brings convenience to people's lives and also brings challenges. Through research on the development status and risks of third-party mobile payment, third-party mobile payment platforms have risks such as financial security risks, legal risks, network and technology risks, and anti-money laundering risks.
        When paying, the electronic money will circulate among banks, users, and merchants, and the risk is in this process. The participation of third-party platforms increases the risk of the entire payment process. Because we must authorize personal information to third-party platforms and bind their accounts, the platform can access all your consumption information and credit status. Your personal privacy may be leaked, and your money may be stolen.
        Third-party payment processors usually use their commercial bank accounts to process payment for their merchant customers. Banks have no direct relationship with merchants. The third-party mobile payment platform is a virtual platform. It is difficult to review users and transactions. For customers who deliberately conceal it, it is difficult for banks to obtain real information. Money laundering is the transformation of a large number of illegal funds into legal funds through certain transactions. Third-party mobile payment platforms may cause important money laundering risks.
        The third-party platforms may be able to strengthen the review of user information and transactions, but it will also increase operating costs and reduce convenience. At the same time, it will reduce a lot of transaction volume. Therefore, third-party mobile payment platforms, out of their own interests, are more likely to choose to do everything possible to increase the number of users and transactions, so that there is less review of users and their information, which will invisibly increase the risk of money laundering (de Luna, 2013).

    <h4>QR codes replace risk<br></h4>
    <p>
        With the use of QR codes, mobile payment has also become an important platform for capital flow. Mobile payment has generated a new type of fraud. One of its modus operandi is that scammers may secretly exchange the QR code charged by the merchant to collect the payment for the merchant. The QR code of the merchant is replaced with the QR code of the merchant. When the QR code wants to pay the merchant, it may be stolen by scammers (Ghiciuc, I,2014).

        This new type of risk mostly occurs when scanning the QR code of strangers. Malicious QR codes are often scanned, or in public places using mobile devices to access hotspots of unknown origin, entering unfamiliar websites full of fraudulent information, and falling into the trap of being cheated of money.

    <h4>Third-party software risk<br></h4>
    <p>
        When we enjoy the convenience of mobile payment, we also need to pay attention to risk, that is, the third-party software you download on your mobile phone. Many criminals use such network loopholes to steal privacy or some funds in our mobile phones. Safety. The risk of mobile phone funds being stolen, or mobile phone information being leaked inexplicably, etc.

        The first is that there is third-party software related to monitoring in the mobile phone. This third-party software may be able to monitor the mobile phone interface in real-time. If a third-party software takes screenshots or screen recordings of your payment QR code and intercepts important account information during the payment process, you are likely to be stolen. This type of software is mostly irregular software. If you find any inexplicable software on your mobile phone, you must be careful.

        There is also the mobile phone being monitored. This risk makes the sound of the mobile phone become smaller when making a call, because it is monitored by a third-party software when we answer the call, and this monitoring needs to be transmitted in real-time, so it will appear. The sound of the call is very small, and the solution is very simple, that is, just turn off the wireless network, because then they can't transmit without the network.

    <h4> Based on smart phones risk<br></h4>
    <p>
        Most mobile payments are based on smartphone platforms. Although the smart phone has great convenience, the phone itself is not and is not perfect, and it has many flaws. And these absences will bring a lot of risks to mobile payment.
        If the mobile phone suddenly runs out of power, is lost or loses the Internet, mobile payment will not be able to conduct transactions, mobile payment will be paralyzed, people still have to continue to use bank cards or cash to conduct transactions.
